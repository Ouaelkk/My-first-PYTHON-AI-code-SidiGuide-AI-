🎓 Sidi Guide 2026 — AI-powered Algerian university orientation. Uses Llama 3.3 via Groq to analyze BAC grades and weighted averages. Advice delivered in Franglais/Darja. 🇩🇿⚡️

### 🚀 Project Spotlight: Sidi Guide 2026

**The Problem:** Every year, BAC students in Algeria struggle with orientation and understanding weighted averages ($Moyenne Pondérée$).

**The Solution:** I built an AI consultant using **Python** and **Groq (Llama 3.3)** that calculates real 2026-style averages and gives personalized advice in a mix of French and Darja.

* **Tech Stack:** `Python` • `Groq API` • `Llama 3.3 70B`
* **Feature:** Auto-calculates Weighted Averages for Math/Tech/Science streams.
* **Vibe:** Encouraging, expert, and 100% localized for the DZ student journey.
